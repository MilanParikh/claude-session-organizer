# Changelog

## 0.8.0

- Session titles now use Claude Code's AI-generated title (`aiTitle`, latest wins). A title set with `/rename` in Claude Code takes precedence; the first prompt is only a fallback for sessions that don't have an AI title yet. Names set in this extension still override everything.
- Performance: transcript titles are cached by file mtime/size, and file-watcher refreshes are debounced. Previously every write to an active session re-read every transcript in the project in full.
- Delete only accepts a `<uuid>.jsonl` inside `~/.claude/projects/`, since commands can be invoked by other extensions with arbitrary arguments. It also trashes the session's sidecar folder (tool results, subagent transcripts).

## 0.7.6

- Remove the list ↔ editor-tab selection sync entirely (it kept fighting with clicking to open). Clicking a session just opens it now; the list selection is left to VS Code's native behavior, so it no longer jumps to a different session.

## 0.7.5

- Fix: clicking a session in the list no longer has its selection stolen by another. The active-tab→list sync (added in 0.7.3) fought with clicking to open — when opening a session didn't focus its editor tab, the list jumped to whatever tab was active. Removed it; opening or searching a session still reveals and selects it.

## 0.7.4

- Fix: clicking a session in the list could select a different one. The list↔active-tab sync now follows the globally active tab (debounced) instead of misfiring on per-group active state.

## 0.7.3

- Opening or switching to a session now reveals it in the list: its group expands and the row is selected.

## 0.7.2

- Add a New Session (➕) button in the view title to start a fresh Claude Code session.

## 0.7.1

- Fix: expanded groups no longer collapse when the list refreshes (e.g. while a session is being written). Each group's expand/collapse state is now preserved across refreshes.

## 0.7.0

- Archive sessions: right-click → Archive moves a session into a collapsed "Archived" group at the bottom (keeping its pin, group, color, and emoji); Unarchive restores it.

## 0.6.3

- Drag sessions onto a group (or Ungrouped) to organize them.
- Show the session count in each group header.

## 0.6.2

- Expand the Pinned and Today groups by default; collapse the others.
- Add a 📌 to the view title.

## 0.6.1

- Renamed to **Claude Session Organizer** (formerly "Toolkit for Claude Code") to better reflect its focus on organizing sessions.

## 0.6.0

- Pin sync: pinning a session's editor tab now also pins it in the list (one-way; unpinning the tab does nothing). Works for sessions opened from the Toolkit list.

## 0.5.2

- Rewrite the README and add a screenshot of the session sidebar.

## 0.5.1

- Unify the pin icon across the activity bar, the session list, and the Marketplace icon (now the native VS Code pushpin).

## 0.5.0

- Set a **color dot** and an **emoji** per session, shown at the start of its label.
- Organize sessions into **custom groups** — when any group is used, the list groups by your groups (Pinned → groups → Ungrouped) instead of by date.

## 0.4.0

- Search sessions by name (search icon in the view title, or "Search Sessions" in the command palette).
- Rename and delete are now inline hover buttons on each session row.

## 0.3.0

- Rename sessions with custom names (right-click → Rename; empty resets to auto title).
- Group sessions by date: Pinned, Today, Yesterday, Previous 7 Days, Previous 30 Days, Older.
- Delete a session (moved to the OS trash, with confirmation).
- Copy a session's ID or transcript path.

## 0.1.1

- Add a Marketplace icon.
- Add a Simplified Chinese README with a language switcher.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release.
- 📌 Session pinning: a sidebar view listing the current workspace's Claude Code
  sessions, with a **Pinned** group that keeps important sessions on top.
- Click a session to open it via the official Claude Code extension.
- Auto-refresh on session changes, plus a manual refresh button.
